# cart_pendulum
Cart-pendulum example for Robot Design Studio 2020

## Overview
Application entry point is `main.m`, which calls (through wrapper functions) dynamics-related functions that are automatically generated by running `derive_equations.m`.

`derive_equations.m` uses symbolic computation to generate the state-space dynamics of the cart-pendulum, which are then exported as MATLAB functions (e.g., `autogen_drift_vector_field.m` and `autogen_control_vector_field.m`).

Additional symbolic math related to optimal swingup control is also implemented in `derive_equations.m`.
